	Another bug reported by Julien Lecomte <julien@famille-lecomte.net>

	* Makefile.in (gnurx-version.dll): Pass CFLAGS in link command.

	* configure.ac (LDFLAGS): Append; don't override user's settings.
	(MINGW_AC_DEFINE_PACKAGE_ID): Increment `PATCHLEVEL'.
	* configure: Regenerated.

2007-05-05  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in (SRCDIST_FILES): Remove reference to `nomsvc'.

2007-05-03  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add `--enable-msvc-implib' configuration option.

	* README (--enable-msvc-implib): Document it.
	* aclocal.m4 (MINGW_AC_MSVC_IMPORT_LIBS): New macro; implement it.

	* configure.ac (MINGW_AC_MSVC_IMPORT_LIBS): Use it to define...
	(GNURX_LIB): ...this; no longer set explicitly.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* Makefile.in (GNURX_LIB): Use AC_SUBST result, in place of...
	(gnurx.lib): ...this, as a prequisite for `all' target.
	(MSVCLIB): Define explicitly; do not use AC_SUBST result.

	* nomsvc: File deleted; it is obsoleted by...
	(MINGW_AC_MSVC_IMPORT_LIBS): ...this aclocal.m4 macro.

	Fix bugs reported by Julien Lecomte <julien@famille-lecomte.net>

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Make them depend on `Makefile', to ensure
	that they will be recompiled after any rerun of `configure'.
	(DEVDIST_FILES): Don't duplicate `regex.h' in `lib'; it's already
	explicitly copied to `include'.

2007-04-30  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Adaptation for distribution as MinGW contributed package.

	* aclocal.m4, configure.ac, pkgid.m4: New files.

	(bindist, devdist, srcdist): New distribution targets.
	(DLLVERSION): New macro; replaces hard coded DLL version tag.
	(srcdir, VPATH): New AC_SUBSTed macros, supporting VPATH build.
	(prefix, exec_prefix, bindir, libdir, includedir, mandir): AC_SUBSTed
	macros, specifying installation directories.
	(LDFLAGS): AC_SUBSTed linker flags.
	(MSVCLIB): New macro; AC_SUBSTed to invoke or avoid use of `lib'.

	(BINDIST_FILES, DEVDIST_FILES, SRCDIST_FILES): New macros.

	* nomsvc: New helper script; invoked if MSVC `lib' not installed.
