Tests:

    00.txt

This is a very basic set of tests.  Absolutely no pretence is made at
significant coverage, as a simple glance at the code will prove.  They
merely test things that are/were broken in either Ponscripter or
ONScripter-En.

If you wish to try them, note that you will need to supply a
default.ttf yourself.  It needs to be a monospaced Japanese font.

Each test prints two lines: an "NScr" line showing the result given by
an up-to-date NScripter, and a "Test" line showing what the
interpreter you're using displays.  If the two are different, you may
have a bug.  (Some tests then print another line, which you can
ignore.)

Some differences of behaviour are expected.  In particular,
ONScripter-En and Ponscripter will display a lot of numbers with
regular ASCII numerals where NScripter uses double-width characters.
This is not exactly a bug (it's by design; building ONScripter-En
without FORCE_1BYTE_CHAR defined will give the NScripter behaviour).
However, builds that display this behaviour will not be 100%
compatible with some Japanese games.

Other differences, like the kinsoku behaviour in test 4, are arguably
bugs in NScripter that are fixed in ONScripter, though the test on the
second page explains _why_ NScripter does that...
