This source code is that used to build static ONScripter executables,
in accordance with the GNU GPL's requirements.

If you want to use these libraries as such, you should probably
download their source code from their respective creators, since the
source provided here has been trimmed somewhat to remove features not
used in ONScripter, tests, documentation, and so forth.
