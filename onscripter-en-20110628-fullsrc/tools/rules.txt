# This is an example rules file for *conv onscripter tools.
# The beginning number tells the number of cells (including alphas) to assume
# for files that match that pattern.
# Patterns are standard regular expressions.
# They are be checked in order for each file, stopping at the first match,
# so it's best to put more general rules later.

# This matches on 'cursor0.bmp' and such, and uses 3 cells.
3   cursor[0-9].bmp

# This matches on files under a directory ending in 'tati', using 2 cells.
# Note the doubled backslashes.
2   tati\\

# This matches on files under the exact directory 'image\tachi', using 2 cells.
2   ^image\\tachi\\

# This is invalid (and skipped) since the number must be greater than 0.
0   blah

# End of rules.
