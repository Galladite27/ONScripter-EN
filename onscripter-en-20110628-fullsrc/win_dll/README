This folder contains a SDL 1.2.13 Win32 DLL and static libraries for
using the DLL with MinGW compilations, but with a Makefile and sdl-config
specifically for compiling ONScripter-EN.

 This is provided for MinGW builds of ONScripter-EN, which would normally
use all static libraries, because MinGW apparently has problems with building
an SDL 1.2 library that can use DirectSound.

 This would not normally be a problem, except that the default Windows
audio system for SDL doesn't handle playing a quick series of short sound
effects properly, apparently because of buffer size issues.

 Luckily, the provided SDL.dll has DirectSound support, and is included to
allow building ONScripter-EN executables that can use DirectSound.

The source code for SDL 1.2.13 is provided under the "extlib" folder.
