BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

* Global variables cannot be set above 4095, even if ;value is set to
  4096 or higher.

* PDA build will be broken; screen ratio cannot be set properly when
  using custom resolutions

* The windows build uses system libraries (but can still build a
  portable executable)

* Linux pop-ups cause a segfault, but only after the script exits
  successfully. This behaviour is the same even when running several
  pop-ups one after another.

* The freetype-config replacement needs to check that it is being
  executed from the correct folder

* Sound bug related to Plumerai and using -s option (or ons.cfg
  equivalent). See bug 1 on github.

* Text is wrapping too soon when using larger resolutions, despite the
  text window being sized correctly (screen ratio variables issue?)


FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.

* Restore support for MOD, XM and OPUS audio.

* Support inbuilt MIDI synthesis.

* Allow the switching of font files mid-line, for example through the
  use of a !fX command, similar to the !wX command.

* Red borders for the Linux pop-ups

* UTF-8 suport bringing in from onscripter-insani


DOCUMENTATION UPDATING LIST
* This section contains changes which need to be made to the
  *NScripter API reference

* Is kinsoku enabled in onsen's english mode?

* ~ and ^ may (will) need updating in relation to onsen's and onani's
  UTF-8 integration


TODO LIST

* Update Windows makefiles
* Bring over UTF-8 suport from onscripter-insani
  - FontInfo, ONScripterLabel_text
  - ScriptHandler (getTextMarker usage, string from int)
    \--> Also wow readToken needs a lot doing to it for UTF-8
    \--> Check if readLabel needs adapting

skipToken
checkClickstr

  - Make a version of the current linewrap algorithm for use with
    proportional fonts
  - Interpret font styles
    * Hold more font styles in FontInfo
    * Recognise ~ tags in script
* UTF-8 features which need properly testing
  - ONScripterLabel_command (gettagCommand) BROKEN
  - ScriptParser_command (basic kinsoku functionality, addkinsokuCommand, setkinsokuCommand)

* Continue working on Windows support with insani
  - Building with internal libraries
  - Integrating custom configure and Makefile into main ones
    * Start by buxfixing the failing checks and tests, primarily
      checks for system libraries
    * Fix the 32/64bit assumptions - broken config.guess?
* Porting additional commands from nscripter?
* "Requested features"
* Implement a fix for the PDA build for the sake of completion
* Redo the "dist" target to make building releases easier


COMPLETED

* Updated dependencies
* Fix to allow saving and loading game during choice selections
* Fix for this fix to allow rgosub to be used in such situations
* Windows builds, plus some compilation changes
* yesnobox and okcancelbox implementation for Linux
* .otf, .otc and .ttc are now allowed in addition to .ttf
* Engine checks for UTF-8 scripts
* Kinsoku system has been converted to UTF-8
* --dll option now only visible on Windows
* ;gameid fixed - ADD TO RELEASE NOTES
* Pretext tags have been converted to UTF-8 (also they're cool)
