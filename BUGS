BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

* Global variables cannot be set above 4095, even if ;value is set to
  4096 or higher.

* PDA build will be broken; screen ratio cannot be set properly when
  using custom resolutions

* Right-clicking during a clickwait doesn't check for if rgosub is
  enabled.

* Using rgosub causes rmenu not to be displayed during select command.
  (high on priority list)

* The windows build uses system libraries (but can still build a
  portable executable)

* Potential bugs related to the new Linux pop-ups? This feature needs
  a good dose of testing
  \--> One interesting point is that UTF-8 characters are already
       displayed properly by this.
  \--> Backtick (used for english text) not removed
       \--> Also seems to be the case in Windows
  \--> Still don't know why it causes a segfault, but only after the
       script exits successfully??

FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.

* Restore support for MOD, XM and OPUS audio.

* Support inbuilt MIDI synthesis.

* Allow the switching of font files mid-line, for example through the
  use of a !fX command, similar to the !wX command.

* Red borders for the Linux pop-ups

* UTF-8 suport bringing in from onscripter-insani

TODO LIST

* Continue working on Windows support with insani
  - Building with internal libraries
  - Integrating custom configure and Makefile into main ones
    * Start by buxfixing the failing checks and tests, primarily
      checks for system libraries
    * Fix the 32/64bit assumptions - broken config.guess?
    * Use -Wall instead of -Werror - there are many "errors" which
      don't end up breaking anything
* rmenu-related bugfixing
* Porting additional commands from nscripter?
* "Requested features"
* Implement a fix for the PDA build for the sake of completion
* Redo the "dist" target to make building releases easier
* Bring over UTF-8 suport from onscripter-insani

COMPLETED

* Updated dependencies
* Fix to allow saving and loading game during choice selections
* Windows builds, plus some compilation changes
* yesnobox and okcancelbox implementation for Linux
