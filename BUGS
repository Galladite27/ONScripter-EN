BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

* Global variables cannot be set above 4095, even if ;value is set to
  4096 or higher.

* PDA build will be broken; screen ratio cannot be set properly when
  using custom resolutions

* The windows build uses system libraries (but can still build a
  portable executable)

* Linux pop-ups cause a segfault, but only after the script exits
  successfully. This behaviour is the same even when running several
  pop-ups one after another.

* Sound bug related to Plumerai and using -s option (or ons.cfg
  equivalent). See bug 1 on github.

* Ruby text doesn't work on line 1 in UTF-8 mode (I hate this error)
* Body is not centred beneath ruby

* UTF-8 save and load menus are *slightly* misaligned due to space
  sizes in proportional fonts. This will be a right pain to fix.
* rmenuCommand probably needs fixing - still assuming columns
* Seung is working on a fix for this in onscripter-insani which can
  probably be adapted to onsen later down the line. Thanks Seung!

* KINSOKU mode needs fixing in processBreaks like SPACEBREAK mode
  \--> Hopefully this is fine but I'm leaving this here for now since
       I haven't properly tested it

* Bug 2 on gh - looks like midi issues - try with old version of
  SDL_mixer as well

* Random crashing when using movie (but not mpegplay) with async on
  Linux
  \--> Only happens on Void, and not on Gentoo

* enginereset causes audio to fail until game is hard reset?

* Engine doesn't give warning when you try to assign to the same alias
  multiple times - currently silently maintains initial value

* There was a Sekai Project employee who commented on PONscripter,
  saying something to the effect of "the entire design of this
  interpreter is arguably a bug." I'm starting to think that about the
  effects timing system in ONScripter-EN. There is only one timer for
  every animated sprite to share, and it obviously gets messy. The
  system ideally needs a re-write to take into account the times for
  every animation, and then provide a command to reset that timer and
  sync animations. The current system becomes particularly egregious
  when you have a slow (say, 5 second) animation and then add a fast
  (say, 100ms) animation. Until the slow animation's timer is
  complete, the fast animation will not advance. Then, the timer will
  be set to the lowest common denominator, and the slow animation will
  be forced to play at 10fps since that's the speed of the fastest
  required timer. I don't know who thought this was a good idea, and
  even if it is for parity with NScripter I don't think anyone would
  resist it being fixed. I'll still have to check, though.

FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.

* Restore support for MOD, XM and OPUS audio.

* Support inbuilt MIDI synthesis.

* Allow the switching of font files mid-line, for example through the
  use of a !fX command, similar to the !wX command.

* Red borders for the Linux pop-ups (do these even exist any more?)

* There should be an option for fullscreen without changing the aspect
  ratio. Perhaps a define-block command which sets this functionality?
  Or should it be changeable at any time during the script?


DOCUMENTATION UPDATING LIST
* This section contains changes which need to be made to the
  *NScripter API reference

* Is kinsoku enabled in onsen's english mode?

* ~ and ^ may (will) need updating in relation to onsen's and onani's
  UTF-8 integration

* Enginereset didn't appear to be on the documentation page, was it
  ever added or does my website just need updating? (Galladite)
  Is this still bugged?

* Add splitonce command (also check if code is fixed lol)

* Add skipspeed command

* Add strpxlen command

* Add notes for CSV commands & update to mention onsen support with
  version number (once released)
  \--> Add csvdelete command

* getreg IS supported in ONScr and ONScr-EN. Explain about how it is emulated.

* Add note to vsp about showing animation 1 sprites causing the
  animation to reset; note that this is the same with other commands
  that unhide sprites such as exbtn

* Add note to exbtn about control string elements which accept number
  ranges as well as individual values


TODO LIST

* Quickly check if splitCommand and splitonceCommand need to use script_h.enc.getBytes()
  \--> Update: they do. This needs fixing.
* Quickly check if enginereset breaks when used in define block
* --key doesn't do anything? Also see OnscripterYuri
* OGG video support for 1080p
* Update Windows makefiles
* Bring over UTF-8 suport from onscripter-insani
  - Interpret font styles
    * Hold more font styles in FontInfo
    * Recognise ~ tags in script
* UTF-8 features which need properly testing
  - ScriptParser_command (basic kinsoku functionality,
    addkinsokuCommand, setkinsokuCommand)
* Continue working on Windows support with insani
  - Building with internal libraries
  - Integrating custom configure and Makefile into main ones
    * Start by buxfixing the failing checks and tests, primarily
      checks for system libraries
    * Fix the 32/64bit assumptions - broken config.guess?
* Porting additional commands from nscripter?
* "Requested features"
* Implement a fix for the PDA build for the sake of completion
* Redo the "dist" target to make building releases easier


COMPLETED

* The freetype-config replacement checks that it is being
  executed from the correct folder
* Updated dependencies
* Fix to allow saving and loading game during choice selections
* Fix for this fix to allow rgosub to be used in such situations
* Windows builds, plus some compilation changes
* yesnobox and okcancelbox implementation for Linux
* .otf, .otc and .ttc are now allowed in addition to .ttf
* Engine checks for UTF-8 scripts
* Kinsoku system has been converted to UTF-8
* --dll option now only visible on Windows
* ;gameid fixed - ADD TO RELEASE NOTES
* Pretext tags have been converted to UTF-8 (also they're cool)
* Captions and clickwait characters can be UTF-8
* Modified linewrap algorithm to work with proportional fonts
* Major bug causing enginereset to wipe global variables
