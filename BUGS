BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

* Global variables cannot be set above 4095, even if ;value is set to
  4096 or higher.

* PDA build will be broken; screen ratio isn't being set properly with
  new custom resolutions

* Right-clicking during a clickwait doesn't check for if rgosub is
  enabled

* You cannot call any menu actions that would break away from the
  selection while in a select command (such as reset or load)
  * I have an idea for a fix for this

* Using rgosub causes rmenu not to be displayed during select command

FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.

* Restore support for MOD, XM and OPUS audio

* Allow the switching of font files mid-line, for example through the
  use of a !fX command, similar to the !wX command.
