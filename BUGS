BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

* Global variables cannot be set above 4095, even if ;value is set to
  4096 or higher.

* PDA build will be broken; screen ratio cannot be set properly when
  using custom resolutions

* The windows build uses system libraries (but can still build a
  portable executable)

* Linux pop-ups cause a segfault, but only after the script exits
  successfully. This behaviour is the same even when running several
  pop-ups one after another.

* The freetype-config replacement needs to check that it is being
  executed from the correct folder

* Sound bug related to Plumerai and using -s option (or ons.cfg
  equivalent). See bug 1 on github.

* UTF-8 Lookback mode: it seems like multibyte characters cause all
  subsequently drawn characters to have far too much spacing

* Rmenu needs fixing - still assuming columns

* Linewrap algorithm (UTF-8) - characters going slightly off-screen
  with default text area width - this is due to only 1px of the area
  needing to be free for it to begin drawing the character, which then
  runs off the side of the area (and potentially the text box or
  screen). 1px now used to be one column. This will likely be fixed
  when I fix the linerap algorithm for UTF-8 mode.

* Ruby text doesn't display properly in UTF-8 mode - probably still
  assuming columns

* Ruby text doesn't work on line 1 in UTF-8 mode (I hate this error)
* Body is not centred beneath ruby

FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.

* Restore support for MOD, XM and OPUS audio.

* Support inbuilt MIDI synthesis.

* Allow the switching of font files mid-line, for example through the
  use of a !fX command, similar to the !wX command.

* Red borders for the Linux pop-ups


DOCUMENTATION UPDATING LIST
* This section contains changes which need to be made to the
  *NScripter API reference

* Is kinsoku enabled in onsen's english mode?

* ~ and ^ may (will) need updating in relation to onsen's and onani's
  UTF-8 integration


TODO LIST

* Update Windows makefiles
* Bring over UTF-8 suport from onscripter-insani
  - Make a version of the current linewrap algorithm for use with
    proportional fonts
  - Many bugfixes
  - Interpret font styles
    * Hold more font styles in FontInfo
    * Recognise ~ tags in script
* UTF-8 features which need properly testing
  - ScriptParser_command (basic kinsoku functionality,
    addkinsokuCommand, setkinsokuCommand)

* Continue working on Windows support with insani
  - Building with internal libraries
  - Integrating custom configure and Makefile into main ones
    * Start by buxfixing the failing checks and tests, primarily
      checks for system libraries
    * Fix the 32/64bit assumptions - broken config.guess?
* Porting additional commands from nscripter?
* "Requested features"
* Implement a fix for the PDA build for the sake of completion
* Redo the "dist" target to make building releases easier


COMPLETED

* Updated dependencies
* Fix to allow saving and loading game during choice selections
* Fix for this fix to allow rgosub to be used in such situations
* Windows builds, plus some compilation changes
* yesnobox and okcancelbox implementation for Linux
* .otf, .otc and .ttc are now allowed in addition to .ttf
* Engine checks for UTF-8 scripts
* Kinsoku system has been converted to UTF-8
* --dll option now only visible on Windows
* ;gameid fixed - ADD TO RELEASE NOTES
* Pretext tags have been converted to UTF-8 (also they're cool)
* Captions and clickwait characters can be UTF-8
