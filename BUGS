BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

* Global variables cannot be set above 4095, even if ;value is set to
  4096 or higher.

* PDA build will be broken; screen ratio cannot be set properly when
  using custom resolutions

* The windows build uses system libraries (but can still build a
  portable executable)

* Linux pop-ups cause a segfault, but only after the script exits
  successfully. This behaviour is the same even when running several
  pop-ups one after another.

* The freetype-config replacement needs to check that it is being
  executed from the correct folder

* Sound bug related to Plumerai and using -s option (or ons.cfg
  equivalent). See bug 1 on github.


FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.

* Restore support for MOD, XM and OPUS audio.

* Support inbuilt MIDI synthesis.

* Allow the switching of font files mid-line, for example through the
  use of a !fX command, similar to the !wX command.

* Red borders for the Linux pop-ups

* UTF-8 suport bringing in from onscripter-insani


DOCUMENTATION UPDATING LIST
* This section contains changes which need to be made to the
  *NScripter API reference

* Commands in onsen 2023-02-20: ;$ autosaveoff savepoint getbgmvol
  getmp3vol getsevol getvoicevol

* Under ;$: add notes about onsen-specific behaviour - the letters
  can be lower case, v option is useless (due to extended variable
  data), note the bug about g option being set above 4095 removing
  global variables, the l option is unimplemented (does it even
  matter? Does onsen have a label limit?)

* Under rgosub: in onsen systemcall DOES work if rgosub is defined

* Under rgosub: please add a reminder to disable rclick within rgosub


TODO LIST

* Change the help text to mention other font types (under -f)
* Bring over UTF-8 suport from onscripter-insani
  - File extension rules with encoding
  - Update Windows makefiles
  - Make a version of the current linewrap algorithm for use with
    proportional fonts
* Continue working on Windows support with insani
  - Building with internal libraries
  - Integrating custom configure and Makefile into main ones
    * Start by buxfixing the failing checks and tests, primarily
      checks for system libraries
    * Fix the 32/64bit assumptions - broken config.guess?
    * Use -Wall instead of -Werror - there are many "errors" which
      don't end up breaking anything
* Porting additional commands from nscripter?
* "Requested features"
* Implement a fix for the PDA build for the sake of completion
* Redo the "dist" target to make building releases easier


COMPLETED

* Updated dependencies
* Fix to allow saving and loading game during choice selections
* Fix for this fix to allow rgosub to be used in such situations
* Windows builds, plus some compilation changes
* yesnobox and okcancelbox implementation for Linux
* .otf, .otc and .ttc are now allowed in addition to .ttf
